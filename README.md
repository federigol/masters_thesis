# Readme

The files in this repository were created as part of my Master's Thesis **Social Distancing in Informal Settlements: Using incentivized Web Surveys in a Volunteer opt-in Panel to create a Case Study of Kibera, Nairobi**. This project was conducted in collaboration with Busara Center for Behavioral Economics.

The R Script contains the following parts:

0. Load packages
1. Import and merge data
2. Clean data and create variables
3. Convert strings to factors and create subsets
4. Data analysis with ggplot2

The first two parts were performed with a data set that contained personally identifiable information (PII). All of the variables with PII were removed after part 2 and the file **data_masters_thesis.csv** was created. It's therefore not possible to replicate parts 1 and 2 when running the **script_masters_thesis_final.R**. Parts 3 and 4 can still be replicated by loading the necessary packages as well as the data and then continuing with part 3.
